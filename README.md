Welcome! This is the code-scripts and hardware repository and presentation material for the [Hardware I1 Seminar on Materializing with machines](http://www.iaacblog.com/programs/courses/mrac/2021-2022-mrac/) at [IAAC MRAC Program](https://iaac.net/educational-programmes/masters-programmes/master-in-robotics-and-advanced-construction-mrac/). This course is a global introduction in design for manufacturing strategies and geometrical pathplanning.

The course is structured in five days, each of which have 3h of theory and practice. Each day introduces to various topics:

- [Day 1](01_introduction): Introduction to design for manufacturing
- [Day 2](02_strategies): Approaches for different case studies and tools introduction
- [Day 3](03_geometrical-development):Structural to fabrication strategies
- [Day 4](04_fabrication): Models fabrication and debuggin.
- [Day 5](05_presentation-contest): Final day for fabrication and testing of models

In each folder, you can find the presentation slides, as well as examples seen during the classes and more material and references.

## Syllabus

Rapid prototyping and advanced manufacturing are fundamental technologies that enable an integrative conception and production of fabrication-informed material and structurally informed design processes.
Additive manufacturing (AM) techniques in architecture are mainly deployed through layer-by-layer or contour crafting. Nowadays there is global collective drift towards the development of a fabrication-informed, adaptive, non-standard architecture.
This intensive workshops will focus on designing and manufacturing spatial non-standard large-scale lightweight structures that outperform the usage of material per
load capabilitie through robotic additive manufacturing.

During this period, students will be challenged to demonstrate their ability in Design for Manufacturing with an robotically 3d printed model of an structural element, intended as an scale bridge in an iterative process of idea generation,fabrication prototyping,reiteration, analysis and learning.

While the seminar and workshops of the MRAC first term focus in tools and abilities exploration, this seminar keeps a horizontal approach at design,tools and techniques in a transdisciplinary point of view.
We will challenge to design a “lightweight” / efficient structure, with spatial frames, and stress forces path planning strategies, not only in the concept of using the least amount of materials, but also by adapting the material deposition to be balanced out between the original geometry and the most perfomative one.

## Learning objectives

The objective of the seminar is to prototype, fabricate and test simple structural models through robotic non-planar additive manufacturing. With an overview of the state of the art in Additive manufacturing spatial frame syntax and its influence in the structural capabilities. Discuss the practical implementation custom endeffectors, and brainstorm to later produce the most performative structural model with this technology. .

At course completion the student will learn:

- Design for manufacturing as one single goal strategy
- Communication between ABB arm robot and custom end effector
- Specific workflows from structural nonplanar additive manufacturing strategies
- How structure capabilities are informed by geometry and materiality
- Students will learn how to calibrate/adjust endeffector tools and possible modification of them.
- To author and prototype robotic additive manucfacturing path planning strategies
- To think independently about novel robotic workflow concepts and implement them in small groups

### Workshop Faculty

Eduardo Chamorro
Digital Fabrication Expert / Fab Academy/ MAA/ MAEBB/ MDEF/ 3DP-OTF Faculty

Eduardo Chamorro is an architect and researcher who works to discover how technology can transform architecture and its processes to improve people’s lives. He holds a Master Degree of Architecture from CEU San Pablo University (Spain), a Fab Academy diploma on Digital Fabrication offered by the Fab Lab Network and a Master Degree in Advanced Architecture from IAAC (Spain), with a specialization in digital fabrication, materiality and new design methodologies.He is currently doing his doctoral studies at Swinburne University in Melbourne in High-performance freeform spatial 3d printing with composites.

He holds a Spanish architectural licence. In addition, he has worked as Fab Lab Seoul director and researcher in several architecture studios, computational design and fabrication professor at CEU University, advisor as fabrication expert for different architecture collectives and he is a usual collaborator in Fab Lab Madrid. He is always seeking to achieve an innovative architecture that attempts to solve and adapt to social needs.
As a digital fabrication expert, he leads the Prototyping courses in MAEB, Design in MDEF, FabAcademy program and 3DP in architecture, MAA2 thesis advisor at IAAC. For him, working in a multi-scalar environment must be the priority of an architect nowadays.
